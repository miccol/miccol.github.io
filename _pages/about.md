I am a postdoctoral researcher at the iCub Facility with the IIT, working in Dr. Lorenzo Natale‘s group.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at KTH, Sweden, working with Prof. Petter Ögren. In April 2017, I received the Ph. D. in Computer Science, from the same institute, supervised by Prof. Petter Ögren, Prof. Dimos V. Dimarogonas, and Dr. Yiannis Karayiannidis. In the Spring semester 2016, I was a visiting scholar at Control and Dynamical Systems lab of Caltech, supervised by Prof. Richard Murray. My principal interests lie in Behavior Trees. I am also interested in control of hybrid systems, automated planning and software architectures with direct applications on robotics platforms.
