> A Behavior Tree (BT) is a way to structure 
the switching between different tasks in 
an autonomous agent, such as a robot or a 
virtual entity in a computer game. BTs are 
a very efficient way of creating complex 
systems that are both modular and reactive.
These properties are crucial in many 
applications, which has led to the spread 
of BT from computer game programming to 
many branches of AI and Robotics. In this 
book, we will first give an introduction 
to BTs, then we describe how BTs relate to,
and in many cases generalize, earlier 
switching structures. These ideas are then 
used as a foundation for a set of efficient
and easy to use design principles. Properties 
such as safety, robustness, and efficiency 
are important for an autonomous system, and 
we describe a set of tools for formally 
analyzing these using a state space description
of BTs. With the new analysis tools, we can 
formalize the descriptions of how BTs generalize
earlier approaches. We also show the use of BTs
in automated planning and machine learning. 
Finally, we describe an extended set of tools 
to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, 
where the outcomes of actions are described
by probabilities. These tools enable the 
computation of both success probabilities 
and time to completion.
