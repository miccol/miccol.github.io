<p>The&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">public</span> projects that I contributed to are the following:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://carve-robmosys.github.io/">CARVE</a></strong></p>
<p>The CARVE project is a first-call Integrated Technical Project (ITP) of the European Horizon H2020 project&nbsp;<a href="https://robmosys.eu/">RobMosys</a>. The project aims at proposing Behavior Trees as a formalism for modeling flexible, composable and reusable hierarchical abstraction for component orchestration in the RobMoSys ecosystem and<br />to develop a set of verification tools for assessing static and run-time properties of robot behaviors. The proposed approach will be validated on real-world scenarios in the domain of service robotics.</p>
<p>In this project, I contributed to the writing of the proposal and deliverables, and the formalization of the Behavior Tree semantic.</p>

<p><a href="http://kiss.caltech.edu/techdev/systems/systems.html"><strong>Resilient Space Systems</strong></a></p>
<p>The Resilient Space Systems project, a<br />joint effort between Caltech, MIT, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the Woods<br />Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). The goal of the project is to define a resilient,<br />risk-aware software architecture for onboard, real-time autonomous operations that can<br />robustly handle uncertainty in spacecraft behavior within hazardous and unconstrained<br />environments, without unnecessarily increasing complexity.</p>
<p>I was involved in this project during my visiting semester at Caltech. I contributed to the outline of the Total System Stability During Goal-Seeking Space Robotics Operations.</p>

<p>The first Amazon Picking Challenge (APC) was held at the<br />2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Seattle, Washington,<br />26&ndash;27 May. The objective of the competition was to provide a challenge<br />problem to the robotics research community that involved integrating the<br />state of the art in object perception,<br />motion planning, grasp planning, and<br />task planning to manipulate real-world<br />items in industrial settings.</p>
<p>I contributed to the design and implementation of the deliberation system in the CVAP entry of the challenge.</p>

<p><a title="Reconfig" href="reconfig.eu"><strong>Reconfig</strong></a></p>
<p>RECONFIG was an FP7-ICT9 European Union project that ran from 2013 to 2016. The project consortium aims at exploiting recent developments in vision, robotics, and control to tackle coordination in heterogeneous multi-robot systems. Such systems hold promise for achieving robustness by leveraging upon the complementary capabilities of different agents and efficiency by allowing sub-tasks to be completed by the most suitable agent.</p>
<p>I was involved in this project during my first 3 years of graduate studies. I contributed to the design and implementation of the deliberation and functional layer of the NAO robots.</p>

<p><strong><a title="SARAFun" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/194263/factsheet/en">SARAFun</a></strong></p>
<p>The SARAFun was a Horizon 2020 European Union project has been formed to enable a non-expert user to integrate a new bi-manual assembly task on a robot in less than a day. This will be accomplished by augmenting the robot with cutting edge sensory and cognitive abilities as well as reasoning abilities required to plan and execute an assembly task.</p>
<p>I was involved in this project during my last year of graduate studies. I contributed to the design and implementation of the systematic synthesis of the behavior trees used to execute assembly tasks.</p>
