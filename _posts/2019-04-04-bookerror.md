To those who bought a copy of the book "Behavior Trees in Robotics and AI: An Introduction" printed in black and white, please contact the publisher directly at randi.cohen@taylorandfrancis.com and request a replacement copy (in color) for free. Apparently, the production error affected both the printed and the ebook.
